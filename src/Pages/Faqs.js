        <strong>Q: How often should I get my hair trimmed?</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        The frequency at which you should get your hair trimmed can vary
        depending on your hair type, its condition, and your personal hair care

          Q: What is the difference between highlights and lowlights?
        </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Highlights and lowlights are hair coloring techniques used to add
        dimension and depth to your hair color. Highlights involve lightening
        specific sections or strands of your hair to create contrast and add
        brightness to your overall hair color. Lowlights, on the other hand,
        involve coloring specific strands of hair with a shade darker than your
        natural hair color.

          transformation?
        </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        A consultation is a preliminary discussion between you and your
        hairstylist before undergoing a major hair transformation. It is an
        essential step when considering significant changes to your hair. Our
        stylists want to make sure that you are receiving the best solution for
        your individual needs!

      </p>
      <p>
        Ask your stylist how often you should visit them in order to keep your
        colored hair looking fresh and vibrant! Be sure to check out our
        color-protecting products that are sold in our online store!

      <p>
        Acrylic nails typically require a fill every 2 to 3 weeks to maintain
        their appearance and structure. The exact frequency may vary based on
        individual nail growth.

      </p>
      <p>
        It's recommended to book your makeup appointment as early as possible,
        especially for special events like weddings. Booking 2-3 months in
        advance ensures availability on your desired date, but last-minute
        appointments may be accommodated based on availability.

        <strong>Q: How long does a typical makeup application take?</strong>

        takes about 60 to 90 minutes, allowing for a thorough and precise

        </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        During your first session, we will have a brief consultation to discuss
        your health history, any specific concerns, and your preferences for the
        massage. You will then have time to undress to your comfort level and
        lie on the massage table under a sheet. Throughout the massage, your
        comfort and privacy will be prioritized.

      <p>
        <strong>Q: Is massage suitable for everyone?</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        While massage is generally safe for most people, certain health
        conditions may contraindicate massage therapy. It's essential to inform
        us of any medical conditions, injuries, or concerns you may have before
        the session. This ensures that the massage can be tailored to your
        specific needs and performed safely.

          Q: How often should I schedule a massage for optimal benefits?
        </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        The frequency of massage depends on individual needs and goals. For
        general relaxation and stress relief, monthly sessions may be
        sufficient. If you're addressing specific issues or injuries, more
        frequent sessions may be recommended initially, with adjustments over
        time.

        </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Swedish massage is a gentle, relaxing technique that uses long, flowing
        strokes, while deep tissue massage focuses on targeting deeper layers of
        muscles and connective tissue to address chronic tension and discomfort.
        The choice between the two depends on your preferences and therapeutic
        goals.
